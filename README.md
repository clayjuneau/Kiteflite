# Kiteflite

Final project for CSCE 315 - Software Engineering Studio at Texas A&M University.

Kiteflite is an Web Application API Mashup consisting of OpenWeatherMap, SkyScanner, and Yelp API.

Often times, the weather is not suitable to fly a kite. Kiteflite allows the user to find the most ideal location for flying a kite and grabbing a bite to eat at any given moment. Then, Kiteflite gives the user flight itinerary to fly there now.

A project by Clay Juneau, Priyanka Paul, and Ryan Cohen
